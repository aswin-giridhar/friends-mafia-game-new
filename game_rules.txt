Mafia Game Rules and Overview - Single Player vs AI
Game Concept
A digital adaptation of Mafia where you (the human player) compete against 6 AI characters in a social deduction game. Your role is randomly assigned each game - you could be a townsperson trying to identify mafia, or you could be mafia trying to eliminate townspeople without being caught.
Game Setup

Total Players: 7 (You + 6 AI characters)
Roles: All players are secretly assigned roles - some are innocent "townspeople" and others are "mafia"
Moderator: Computer system manages all game flow, announcements, and rule enforcement

Core Roles
Mafia/Wolves

Goal: Eliminate all townspeople without being discovered
Abilities: Mafia members coordinate to vote and eliminate one townsperson each night
Ratio: 2 mafia members out of 7 total players (could include you)
If You're Mafia: You coordinate with 1 AI mafia partner to eliminate townspeople while blending in during day phases

Townspeople/Villagers

Goal: Identify and eliminate all mafia members through voting
Abilities: Vote during day phases to eliminate suspected mafia
Composition: 5 total townspeople (you might be one of them)

Special Townsperson Roles (Recommended for 7-player game)

Detective/Investigator: Can investigate one player each night to learn their role (you might be assigned this role)
Doctor/Medic: Can protect one player each night from being eliminated (you might be assigned this role)
Regular Townspeople: Standard townspeople with no special abilities (you might be assigned this role)

Game Phases
Night Phase

Computer announces night phase begins
If you're Mafia: You coordinate with your AI mafia partner to choose who to eliminate
If you have a special town role (Detective/Doctor): You're prompted to make your action
If you're a regular townsperson: You wait while others make their moves
AI characters make their actions based on their roles and strategies
Computer processes all actions and determines results

Day Phase

Computer announces night results (who was eliminated, any protected players, etc.)
All remaining players (you + remaining AI) participate in discussion
Your strategy depends on your role:

If Townsperson: Analyze AI behavior, ask questions, make accusations to find mafia
If Mafia: Blend in, deflect suspicion, help eliminate townspeople while appearing innocent


AI characters respond with programmed personalities and strategies
Voting phase: Everyone votes for who to eliminate
Player with most votes is eliminated and their role is revealed
Computer checks victory conditions

Victory Conditions

If you're a Townsperson: You win when all mafia members are eliminated (even if you don't survive)
If you're Mafia: You win when mafia members equal or outnumber the remaining townspeople
Game ends: When either all mafia are eliminated OR mafia reach parity with townspeople

Key Game Mechanics
Voting

During day phase, you select who to vote for elimination via game interface
AI characters vote based on their roles, personalities, and programmed strategies
Majority vote eliminates the selected player (ties handled by computer rules)

Communication Rules

If you're Mafia: You can coordinate with your AI mafia partner during night phases
If you're Townsperson: You participate in open day phase discussions only
During day phases, you interact with AI characters through dialogue options
AI characters respond based on their roles and programmed behaviors
You must deduce roles based on AI behavior patterns, voting history, and responses

Information Flow

You receive information based on your role:

All players: Night results, eliminations, role reveals when players die
If you're Detective: Private investigation results each night
If you're Doctor: Knowledge of who you protected and if it was successful
If you're Mafia: Knowledge of who your mafia partner is and coordination during night kills



Strategy Elements Based on Your Role
If You're a Townsperson

Observe AI Patterns: Look for suspicious behaviors, voting patterns, and responses
Use Special Abilities: If Detective/Doctor, use information strategically without revealing your role too early
Build Trust: Form alliances with other townspeople
Question Suspects: Use dialogue to probe for inconsistencies in AI responses

If You're Mafia

Blend In: Act like a concerned townsperson during day phases
Coordinate Strategically: Work with your AI mafia partner to eliminate key threats (especially Detective/Doctor)
Misdirect Suspicion: Point fingers at innocent players to create confusion
Survive Voting: Avoid drawing attention while helping eliminate townspeople
Manage Information: Be careful not to reveal knowledge you shouldn't have as a "townsperson"

Implementation Considerations for Single Player Code
AI Character System

Personalities: Each AI character needs distinct behavioral patterns and dialogue
Role-based Decision Making: AI behavior changes based on their assigned role
Mafia Coordination: AI mafia members need to coordinate automatically without player visibility
Believable Responses: AI should respond realistically to accusations and questions

Player Interface

Role-Specific Actions: Interface adapts based on your assigned role

Mafia: Night coordination with AI partner, target selection
Detective: Investigation target selection, results display
Doctor: Protection target selection, success notifications
Regular Townsperson: Observation and discussion only


Dialogue System: Options to question, accuse, or discuss with AI characters
Voting Interface: Clear voting mechanism during day phases
Information Display: Role-appropriate information (voting history, elimination results, special role info)

Game Flow Management

Automated Phases: Computer handles all timing and phase transitions
Role Assignment: Balanced random assignment ensuring proper mafia/townspeople ratio
AI Decision Processing: AI characters make decisions automatically based on their roles and strategies
Victory Detection: Automatic win/loss condition checking

Recommended Role Distribution for 7 Players:

2 Mafia members (you could be one of them)
1 Detective (you might be assigned this role)
1 Doctor (you might be assigned this role)
3 Regular Townspeople (you might be assigned this role)

Random Role Assignment System

Each game randomly assigns you one of the available roles
AI characters fill the remaining roles automatically
Role distribution remains balanced (2 mafia, 5 townspeople) regardless of your assignment
Your gameplay experience changes dramatically based on your role assignment
